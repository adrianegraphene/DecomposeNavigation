        We will send all unknown calls to your voicemail unless they leave you a $0.05 NanoDeposit.
        If an unknown call rings more than once, it means they have left you a NanoDeposit.
        Answer  the call to find out who left you a deposit.
        If you don\'t  like the call, just hang up before 25 seconds and keep the deposit.

    <string name="FAQ">FAQ</string>
    <string name="Info_FAQ">
        What is KarmaCall?
        \n
        \nKarmaCall is a phone application that allows you to block annoying spam and telemarketer calls
        while making money in the process!
        \n
        \nHow does KarmaCall function?
        \nWe pay you every time you let us block a call for you.
        \n
        \nIf the phone number that is calling you is not in your contacts list, KarmaCall will require a
        small nano deposit for that caller to call you. If you answer that call and hang up before 25 seconds,
        you get to keep the nano deposit. If you answer and the call last longer than 25 seconds, the full nano
        deposit will be refunded to the caller. If the caller leaves a NanoDeposit and you do not answer,
        the caller is fully refunded. If the caller does not leave a NanoDeposit, they are sent
        straight to your voicemail.
        \n
        \nHow can I stop blocking phone calls?
        \n
        \nClick the main menu (upper left hand side). Click the \"Stop/Start Blocking\" blocking option.
        Click the \"No\" option on the message that pops up. Now, when you access the Android Quick Settings menu
        (just drag your finger from the top of your screen downward), you should no longer see KarmaCall running.
        \n
        \nHow can I start blocking phone calls again?
        \n
        \nClick the main menu (upper left hand side). Click the \"Stop/Start Blocking\" blocking option.
        Click the \"Yes\" option on the message that pops up. Now, when you access the Android Quick Settings menu
        (just drag your finger from the top of your screen downward), you should see KarmaCall running.
        \n
        \nWhy are there several permissions to use KarmaCall and what do they mean?
        \n
        \nWe ask you for 2 permissions:
        \n 1. Access Contacts
        \n 2. Make and Manage Phone Calls
        \n
        \nIn order for our app to successfully block callers,
        \nwe need access to your contact list so we can block or allow the correct calls. We cannot see,
        change or manage your contacts list at all. Along with contacts, we need to manage phone calls,
        which gives us the ability to block calls for you. We will not change the way your phone operates in any other way.
        \n
        \nWhy do I need to provide my phone number?
        \n
        \nKarmaCall needs your phone number so we can create a nano account for you. We only ask for your phone number once
        and do not use or share this information with anyone. Your privacy is extremely valuable and we will
        keep it that way. If you still have concerns, please read our Privacy Policy or contact us at support@karmacall.com
        \n
        \nWhat is the 6 digit password that was texted to me when I verified my phone number?
        \n
        \nThis is called a One Time Password (OTP).
        \nThis password is a verification method to make sure you are you. It is very important that you DO NOT SHARE this
        password with anyone, as it can give someone else access to your account and information.
        \nMake sure you enter this password and delete it once your phone number has been verified.
        \n
        \nDoes KarmaCall collect my personal information?
        \n
        \nAbsolutely not.
        \nThe only information we need is your phone number. We do not need any of your personal information and your
        privacy is a primary concern for us. If you have any further questions, please read our Privacy Policy
        or contact us at support@karmacall.com
        \n
        \nHow can I see my balance?
        \n
        \nYou can view your balance on the “Wallet” page, which can be accessed by using the main
        navigation menu. Your balance will be displayed at the top of that page as USD currency.
        Furthermore, you can click the “WITHDRAW” button and this page will display your balance
        in USD and nano currencies.
        \n
        \nWhat is nano?
        \n
        \nnano is a digital currency based on blockchain technology. It is designed to be fast,
        scalable and has zero fees! Every account is assigned its own blockchain. To learn more,
        you can visit
        \nhttps://docs.nano.org/what-is-nano/overview
        \n
        \nWhat is a nano account, and what does KarmaCall do with it?
        \n
        \nThink of your nano account with KarmaCall as a digital coin purse or a small money bag.
        You can withdraw and spend small amounts of money with our help.
        Every time you block a call, We deposit money into your nano account. If an unsolicited caller calls
        you and you hang up before 25 seconds, the deposit of that caller goes into your nano account.
        This nano account is associated with your phone number, but you can create external nano accounts if
        you want to withdraw nano from your KarmaCall account to an external nano account that you own.
        \n
        \nWhat options do I have to withdraw my nano balance?
        \n
        \nThere are several options to withdraw a nano balance. First, you can enter an external
        nano account address, and simply withdraw the funds directly to that account. If you do not have
        an external nano account address, we recommend downloading the Nalli app or Natrium app.
        You can find these wallet apps and more, in this link. https://nanowallets.guide
        \nSecond, you can withdraw the funds in the form of gift cards. This feature is still being
        developed and is not expected until November 21st, 2021.
        If you would like to try this out on your own outside the app, visit https://nanogate.io
        \n
        \nHow can I add funds to my nano balance?
        \n
        \nCurrently, we do not have a deposit functionality in the App to allow users to add funds
        to their KarmaCall nano account. However, we do have a faucet which allows you to receive a
        small amount of nano to start using immediately for free!
        \n
        \nWhat is a faucet?
        \n
        \nA nano faucet is just like a sink faucet, except it dispenses small denominations of digital
        currency, in our case nano. Our faucet can be used once by each user. This can be done by
        navigating to the “Wallet” page and clicking the “FAUCET = FREE $$$” button. Using our
        faucet will give you 0.0001 nano.
        \n
        \nHow do I use the faucet?
        \n
        \nJust simply click our “FAUCET = FREE $$$” button on the “Wallet” page and you will
        instantly get nano to use for free!
        \n
        \nWhat can I do with the nano I receive from the faucet?
        \n
        \nPlease visit https://usenano.org  to see the different ways you can use your nano. Within the
        KarmaCall app, the nano you get from our Faucet will allow you to make 5 free outbound calls
        to receivers who do not have you (the caller) as a contact. This will give you the
        opportunity to try out more functionalities of KarmaCall.
        \n
        \nHow can I get into contact with support if I need any assistance?
        \n
        \nYou can navigate to our “Contact Us” page located on the App’s main navigation menu in the
        top left hand corner.
        On this page, you simply click the “SEND EMAIL” button, select the email app you would
        like to use to send the email, and send. Your feedback is important to us. We want to help
        with any issues you may be experiencing. Let us know how we can make your experience
        the best we possibly can!
        \n
        \nI am new to the app, where can I find an app demo or tutorial?
        \n
        \nA demo of the app (or video tutorial) will be located on the main page of our website starting
        by November 1st, 2021.
        \n
        \nKarmaCall is free. Am I the product?
        \n
        \nYes, you are the product and our mission is to get you paid what you deserve. Currently,
        you do not get paid for the data you give out every day. Instead, most companies make money
        by selling your attention to advertisers. We invented a way to force companies to pay you for
        your time in order to get your attention.
        \nOur technology will be used to help businesses get in contact with real, honest
        customers like you. Businesses will pay you in order to keep you on the line or you can just
        hang up on them right away to collect their deposit! Either way, we want to give you the power
        to get paid for your data and time. Of course, a fraction of these payments
        will be kept by KarmaCall so we can continue to improve our technology to create
        a world in which we can have meaningful communications again! Our mission
        is to get you paid for your data and to convince other companies that they should be paying you
        for your data too.

    <string name="GDPR_Description">The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect on May 25, 2018 in the
        European Union. The GDPR applies to every company that processes EU citizens’ PII
        (Personally Identifiable Information). This new law prioritizes the importance of the
        protection and privacy of your personal information in several key areas. The state of
        California recently passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). All the rights of
        CCPA are met by complying with the GDPR which KarmaCall does, as described below.
        \n\nFirst, KarmaCall provides the ability to consent to data collection in an easily accessible
        format. At KarmaCall, we store your personal contact information – phone number, digital wallet,
        as well as data concerned with our performance of contract which in part captures digital
        wallet transactions for anti-spam purposes and length of your call times for improving our
        services. Along with your basic contact information, we use Flurry Analytics to track how you
        use our application so we can learn how to improve it to make your experience as enjoyable as
        possible. Any other data which is VOLUNTARILY provided by you (demographics and
        psychographics), but is not required for our spam-blocking features, will be stored as well.
        \n\nSecond, KarmaCall supplies the opportunity to request your data. We display the data
        currently held under your user and/or business entity in a user-friendly format.
        KarmaCall does not sell or provide your data to any 3rd party sources for any reason.
        \n\nThird, KarmaCall presents the option to have all data we have collected, deleted on request.
        If you make this request, we will comply without undue delay except as required by other
        laws. For example, some financial data may not be deleted if it is required for tax records.
